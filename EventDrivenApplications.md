# Event Driven Applications

## What native Node.js module allows us to get started with Event Driven Programming?
There is a module called events have a class EventEmitter.

## What is the value of Object Oriented Programming used in tandem with Event Driven Programming?
When used in tandem, OOP and event-driven programming can complement each other and offer several benefits Modularity and Reusability, Separation of Concerns ,Flexibility and Extensibility, and Asynchronous Programming.
## Consider your knowledge of Event Driven Programming in the Web Browser, now explain to a non-technical friend how Event Driven Programming might be useful on the backend using Node.js.
Event-driven programming in Node.js on the backend is like a host at a party who can efficiently handle multiple requests from different users at the same time. For example, when a user sends a request to the server, it's similar to a guest asking for something at the party. The server uses event-driven programming to listen for these requests as events and respond accordingly. This approach ensures that the server doesn't get overwhelmed and can handle requests simultaneously. It's like the host handling various requests from different guests without making others wait. This improves the server's performance, responsiveness, and scalability, allowing it to serve a large number of users efficiently. Just like a good party host, event-driven programming in Node.js enables the backend to smoothly handle numerous tasks and interactions, resulting in a seamless user experience.
