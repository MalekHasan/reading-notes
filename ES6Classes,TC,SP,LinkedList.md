# ES6 Classes,Time complexity ,Space complexity and Linkedlist
 #### Today we learned an important topics like ***ES6 Classes,Time complexity ,Space complexity and Linkedlist.***

 ## Class:
 In ES6 we found a new way to declare and built the object using the class which is **user data type define and it's like a template or blueprint for the objects** and this class consist of ***properties (data members) and methode (function members) which is the action of this object.***
 ## Time Comlpexity :
which is the time that we measure from what is the time that we have when we implement steps and there is a measurment for the complexity ***start from O(1),O(log n),O(n),O(nlog n),O(n^2) and end with O(n!) ,good to worest respctivly***, ex:  
_static loop =>O(1)_  
_dynamic loop =>O(n)_  
_if condition => O(1)_
## Space Comlexit:
which is the space that we reserved in the memory when we declare variables , functions or classes ex:  
_const a= 1; =>O(1)_  
_function(arr){  
let myArr=arr; =>O(n)  
}_
## LinkedList:
 LinkedList it's a kind of Data structures which is a set of Node and each node consist of value(data) and next(pointer) and this pointer refer to the next element in this LinkedList ex:  
_music Playlist each music point to the next music in the list._
