# Graphs

1. Graph: A non-linear data structure consisting of nodes (vertices) and edges that represent relationships or connections between the nodes.

2. Node (Vertex): An entity or element in a graph. It represents a single point in the graph and can store additional information if needed.

3. Edge: A connection between two nodes in a graph. It represents the relationship or connection between the nodes.

4. Adjacency List: A common way to represent a graph where each node is associated with a list (array or set) of its neighboring nodes.

5. Directed Graph: A graph in which the edges have a specific direction, indicating a one-way relationship between nodes.

6. Undirected Graph: A graph in which the edges do not have a specific direction, indicating a two-way relationship between nodes.

7. Weighted Graph: A graph in which each edge is assigned a weight or value. It represents the cost or distance between nodes.

8. Traversal: The process of visiting or accessing all nodes in a graph. It can be done using various algorithms, such as depth-first search (DFS) or breadth-first search (BFS).

9. Connectivity: The property of a graph that determines whether all nodes are reachable from any other node. It helps identify if there are isolated components in the graph.

10. Cycle: In a directed graph, a cycle is a path that starts and ends at the same node, passing through other nodes in between.

11. Spanning Tree: A subgraph of a graph that is a tree (no cycles) and connects all nodes of the original graph.

12. Graph Algorithm: A procedure or set of rules used to solve problems or perform operations on graphs, such as finding the shortest path or detecting cycles.
