#  Express, NPM, TDD, CI/CD

## An introduction to NodeJS and Express


1. ### Explain middleware, answer as though I were a non-technical recruiter.

**middleware functions is function can make or perform some operation or process on the request and respone and change on them. So middlewares allow us to access the response and request and do some process on them.**

2. ### Express the most popular __ __ ____.
Express the most popular **Node web framework**.

3. ### Express is “unopinionated.” What does that mean?

**Unopinionated frameworks, have far fewer restrictions on the best way to glue components together to achieve a goal, or even what components should be used. They make it easier for developers to use the most suitable tools to complete a particular task, albeit at the cost that you need to find those components yourself.**

4. ### What is a module and why is modularity useful to us as developers?

**It's a separate part of code in file thaat we use make the code reusable and easier to maintaind**

## What is NPM?

1. ### What version of npm are you running on your machine?

**9.5.0**

 2. ### What command would you type to install a library/package called ‘jshint’ into your node project?

 **npm i jshint**

 ## What is TDD?

1. ### Explain why tests are important. Please explain as though I were your non technical elder.

Testing is important in software development because it's can avoid unexpected error software development before we push the code to main code in github and do merge for a diffrent branches.

2. ### What are three expected benefits of testing?

- Avoid an expected error in software development by detect bugs.

- Decrease our effort in last steps in development life cycle and improve the maintenance process 

- Increase the quality of our software and increase the reliability

3. ### Name at lest 2 individual pitfalls and at least 2 team pitfalls commonly encountered while writing tests.

- forgetting to run tests frequently
- writing too many tests at once a time

## CI/CD
1. ### What are three benefits of Continuous Integration?

2. ### What is the difference between Continuos Delivery and Continuous Deployment?
- Early Bug Detection 
- Faster Feedback Loop
- Avoid merge hell
**Continuos Delivery it's a process to make sure that our work or code is ready to be deployed ,however ,Continuous Deployment it's a process to make sure that every change that passes through the automation test is deplyed directly to production**

3. ### Explain how GitHub fits into this process assuming the listener comes from a non-technical background

**GitHub is a platform that helps store, manage, and collaborate on code. It allows teams to work together, track changes, and review code.**
