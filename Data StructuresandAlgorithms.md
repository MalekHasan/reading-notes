# Data Structures and Algorithms

1. ## What is 1 of the more important things you should consider when deciding which data structure is best suited to solve a particular problem?

 **Big (o) which is the time complexity**

 2. ## How can we ensure that weâ€™ll avoid an infinite recursive call stack?
 **By using the base-case which is stopping the recursive**
